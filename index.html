				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional or psychological strain.Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, and it can have both positive and negative effects on the body and mind. When we experience stress, our bodies release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which help us to respond to the perceived threat or challenge.
					These hormones can have beneficial effects, such as increasing focus and alertness, but they can also have negative effects if they are present in high levels or for prolonged periods of time.
				</p>

				<h2>Negative Effects of Stress on the Brain</h2>
				<p>Chronic or prolonged stress can have negative effects on the brain, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Causing rapid release of norepinephrine (NE) and glucocorticoids (GCs), both of which bind to hippocampal receptors(Hippocampus is a complex brain structure embedded deep into temporal lobe. It has a major role in learning and memory). Behaviorally, human and animal studies have found that stress generally impairs various hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. Neurally, animal studies have revealed that stress alters ensuing synaptic plasticity and firing properties of hippocampal neurons. Structurally, human and animal studies have shown that stress changes neuronal morphology, suppresses neuronal proliferation, and reduces hippocampal volume. Since the inception of stress research nearly 80 years ago, much focus has been on the varying levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine hormones, namely glucocorticoids, as mediators of the myriad stress effects on the hippocampus and as contributing factors to stress-associated psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, reports of glucocorticoid-produced alterations in hippocampal functioning vary widely across studies. This review provides a brief history of stress research, examines how the glucocorticoid hypothesis emerged and guides contemporary stress research, and considers alternative approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying stress effects on hippocampal functioning.</li>

				<h2>Managing Stress</h2>
				<p>There are a number of strategies that can help to manage stress and its negative effects on the brain:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Learning to cope with the stress will make you become resilient to stress.


Maintain a daily routine
Carrying out routine activities reduces stress by making the situation appear more controllable and predictable," says Indumathi Bendi, M.D., a primary care physician at Piedmont. "Preparedness is a key way to prevent stress.
<br>
Good sleep habits (sleep hygiene) 
				<br>
Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends getting enough sleep least 8 hours, a night is good for both our body and mind. Sleep repairs, relaxes, rejuvenate our body and reverses the effect of stress.
Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature
<br>
Remove electronic devices, such as TVs, computers, and smart phones, from the bedroom
<br>			
Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before you sleep
				<br>
A balanced diet can support a healthy immune system and the repair of damaged cells. It provides the extra energy needed to cope with stressful events. Early research suggests that certain foods like polyunsaturated fats including omega-3 fats and vegetables may help to regulate cortisol levels.						
<br>
Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night
		<br>
Almost any form of exercise or movement can increase your fitness level while decreasing your stress. The most important thing is to pick an activity that you enjoy. Examples include walking, stair climbing, jogging, dancing, bicycling, yoga, tai chi, gardening, weightlifting and swimming</li>
<br>
Socializing
<br>
Adequate amounts of social support are associated with increases in levels of a hormone called oxytocin, which functions to decrease anxiety levels and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system calming down responses.
