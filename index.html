				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, and it can have both positive and negative effects on the body and mind. When we experience stress, our bodies release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which help us to respond to the perceived threat or challenge.
					These hormones can have beneficial effects, such as increasing focus and alertness, but they can also have negative effects if they are present in high levels or for prolonged periods of time.

				<h2>Negative Effects of Stress on the Brain</h2>
				<p>Chronic or prolonged stress can have negative effects on the brain, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Uncontrollable stress has been recognized to influence the hippocampus at various levels of analysis. Behaviorally, human and animal studies have found that stress generally impairs various hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. Neurally, animal studies have revealed that stress alters ensuing synaptic plasticity and firing properties of hippocampal neurons. Structurally, human and animal studies have shown that stress changes neuronal morphology, suppresses neuronal proliferation, and reduces hippocampal volume. Since the inception of stress research nearly 80 years ago, much focus has been on the varying levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine hormones, namely glucocorticoids, as mediators of the myriad stress effects on the hippocampus and as contributing factors to stress-associated psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, reports of glucocorticoid-produced alterations in hippocampal functioning vary widely across studies. This review provides a brief history of stress research, examines how the glucocorticoid hypothesis emerged and guides contemporary stress research, and considers alternative approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying stress effects on hippocampal functioning.</li>

				<h2>Managing Stress</h2>
				<p>There are a number of strategies that can help to manage stress and its negative effects on the brain:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Exercise and physical activity</li>
					<li>Meditation and mindfulness</li>
					<li>Time management and stress-reducing techniques such as prioritizing tasks and delegating responsibilities</li>
					<li>Maintaining a healthy diet and getting enough sleep</li>
					<li>Seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional</li>
				</ul>
