      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, and it can have both positive and negative effects on the body and mind. When we experience stress, our bodies release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which help us to respond to the perceived threat or challenge. These hormones can have beneficial effects, such as increasing focus and alertness, but they can also have negative effects if they are present in high levels or for prolonged periods of time.</p>
