				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Stress can be defined as any type of change that causes physical, emotional or psychological strain.Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, and it can have both positive and negative effects on the body and mind. When we experience stress, our bodies release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which help us to respond to the perceived threat or challenge.
					These hormones can have beneficial effects, such as increasing focus and alertness, but they can also have negative effects if they are present in high levels or for prolonged periods of time.

				<h2>Negative Effects of Stress on the Brain</h2>
				<p>Chronic or prolonged stress can have negative effects on the brain, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Causing rapid release of norepinephrine (NE) and glucocorticoids (GCs), both of which bind to hippocampal receptors(Hippocampus is a complex brain structure embedded deep into temporal lobe. It has a major role in learning and memory). Behaviorally, human and animal studies have found that stress generally impairs various hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. Neurally, animal studies have revealed that stress alters ensuing synaptic plasticity and firing properties of hippocampal neurons. Structurally, human and animal studies have shown that stress changes neuronal morphology, suppresses neuronal proliferation, and reduces hippocampal volume. Since the inception of stress research nearly 80 years ago, much focus has been on the varying levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis neuroendocrine hormones, namely glucocorticoids, as mediators of the myriad stress effects on the hippocampus and as contributing factors to stress-associated psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, reports of glucocorticoid-produced alterations in hippocampal functioning vary widely across studies. This review provides a brief history of stress research, examines how the glucocorticoid hypothesis emerged and guides contemporary stress research, and considers alternative approaches to understanding the mechanisms underlying stress effects on hippocampal functioning.</li>

				<h2>Managing Stress</h2>
				<p>There are a number of strategies that can help to manage stress and its negative effects on the brain:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Learning to cope with the stress will make you become resilient to stress.


Maintain a daily routine

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic social restrictions a lot of people are forced to stay at home. Having a daily schedule can help us use our time efficiently and not feel bored. Set time for regular meals, working from home, spending time with family members, exercise, daily chores and other recreational activities. 

Sleep Adequately

Getting enough sleep least 8 hours, a night is good for both our body and mind. Sleep repairs, relaxes, rejuvenate our body and reverses the effect of stress.

Good sleep habits (sleep hygiene) can help you improve your sleep:

Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends
Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature
Remove electronic devices, such as TVs, computers, and smart phones, from the bedroom
Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime
Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.
 

Connect with others ​
The disruption to work, employment, family life, incomes and education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is widespread. Different individuals respond to such situations in different manner. To some, the effects have little impact on their mental well-being. For, others, it can cause different levels of distress. This is true for all age-groups including adolescents.

There are some mental health conditions that are caused or exacerbated in some individuals in such circumstances, that need immediate action. Two such conditions are anxiety and depression, which need psychological or medical support. Therefore, it is important that common symptoms of such conditions are identified early. We also must understand that some of these symptoms are similar to symptoms of stress. However, these are more persistent and lead to greater distress and more commonly affect the day to day functioning of a person, including work and education.

Due to the current COVID-19 social restrictions a lot of people are isolated and not able to meet their loved ones. Keep in touch with family and friends through various means such as video calls, phone calls etc. while respecting physical distancing norms. Staying in touch with our dear ones is essential for our mental well-being.

Eat Healthy​

What we eat and drink can affect our health, eating a healthy diet is very important to prevent or recover from diseases.A balanced diet and at regular intervals as well as appropriate amounts of water exers
H, we can do a lot of physical exercises at home such as treadmills, skipping, climbing stairs, push up, planks etc.</li>
